A simple calculator... Nothing else

I am using the cmatrix program as a booting matrix rain interface.

The original CMatrix program was created by Chris Allegretta. It's a terminal-based program that simulates the "digital rain" effect from the movie The Matrix. While various versions and ports exist on platforms like macOS and modern Linux distributions, the credit for the original project goes to Allegretta.

I do not intend to steal any file or program from them.
